# Etch-a-Sketch
Hello there! Welcome to my own **Etch-a-Sketch** Project from _**The Odin Project**_! The goal here is to have a square grid made of little squares to make a sketchpad for pixelated drawings! At the end of the project, I want to give the user the ability to:
- choose from a few dimensions for the sketchpad (16x16, 32x32, 64x64),
- erase, 
- draw in black,
- or draw in random RGB colors!
